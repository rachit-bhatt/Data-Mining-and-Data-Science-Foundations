# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is from Kaggle and includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and fare paid. The goal is to build and evaluate predictive models that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not.

## Project Structure
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis pipeline.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the code.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Titanic dataset files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/[yourusername]/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```

2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open and run the `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
3. Modify the notebook as needed for further experimentation or improvements.

## Results
- The notebook includes detailed analysis of the dataset, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Insights into factors influencing survival rates among Titanic passengers are discussed, based on the models and visualizations created.
